# Quiz: Pixels to Real-World

~~~python
# Define conversions in x and y from pixels space to meters
ym_per_pix = 30/720 # meters per pixel in y dimension
xm_per_pix = 3.7/700 # meters per pixel in x dimension
~~~

In the quiz below, use the above conversions to adjust your calculation from before to give real-world lane curvature values. Once again, you'll focus on the `left_curverad` and `right_curverad` values within the new `measure_curvature_real()` function. However, you will also need to adjust how you use `np.polyfit()` within `generate_data()` in order for this to work. How do you need to change thse to convert to meters?

Write the code:

~~~python
import numpy as np

def generate_data(ym_per_pix, xm_per_pix):
    '''
    Generates fake data to use for calculating lane curvature.
    In your own project, you'll ignore this function and instead
    feed in the output of your lane detection algorithm to
    the lane curvature calculation.
    '''
    # Set random seed number so results are consistent for grader
    # Comment this out if you'd like to see results on different random data!
    np.random.seed(0)
    # Generate some fake data to represent lane-line pixels
    ploty = np.linspace(0, 719, num=720)# to cover same y-range as image
    quadratic_coeff = 3e-4 # arbitrary quadratic coefficient
    # For each y position generate random x position within +/-50 pix
    # of the line base position in each case (x=200 for left, and x=900 for right)
    leftx = np.array([200 + (y**2)*quadratic_coeff + np.random.randint(-50, high=51) 
                                    for y in ploty])
    rightx = np.array([900 + (y**2)*quadratic_coeff + np.random.randint(-50, high=51) 
                                    for y in ploty])

    leftx = leftx[::-1]  # Reverse to match top-to-bottom in y
    rightx = rightx[::-1]  # Reverse to match top-to-bottom in y

    # Fit a second order polynomial to pixel positions in each fake lane line
    ##### TO-DO: Fit new polynomials to x,y in world space #####
    ##### Utilize `ym_per_pix` & `xm_per_pix` here #####
    left_fit_cr = np.polyfit(ploty, leftx, 2)
    right_fit_cr = np.polyfit(ploty, rightx, 2)
    
    return ploty, left_fit_cr, right_fit_cr

    
def measure_curvature_real():
    '''
    Calculates the curvature of polynomial functions in meters.
    '''
    # Define conversions in x and y from pixels space to meters
    ym_per_pix = 30/720 # meters per pixel in y dimension
    xm_per_pix = 3.7/700 # meters per pixel in x dimension
    
    # Start by generating our fake example data
    # Make sure to feed in your real data instead in your project!
    ploty, left_fit_cr, right_fit_cr = generate_data(ym_per_pix, xm_per_pix)
    
    # Define y-value where we want radius of curvature
    # We'll choose the maximum y-value, corresponding to the bottom of the image
    y_eval = np.max(ploty)
    
    ##### TO-DO: Implement the calculation of R_curve (radius of curvature) #####
    left_curverad = 0  ## Implement the calculation of the left line here
    right_curverad = 0  ## Implement the calculation of the right line here
    
    return left_curverad, right_curverad


# Calculate the radius of curvature in meters for both lane lines
left_curverad, right_curverad = measure_curvature_real()

print(left_curverad, 'm', right_curverad, 'm')
# Should see values of 533.75 and 648.16 here, if using
# the default `generate_data` function with given seed number
